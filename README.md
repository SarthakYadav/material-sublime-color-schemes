# material-sublime-color-schemes
bare minimal color schemes for the Material Theme for Sublime Text 3, which comprise of elements based mostly on shades of blue.

Consists of two themes (tmTheme Files) them:

1. Material Theme:- Blue color scheme
2. Material Theme-Darker :- Blue color scheme

and related screenshots.

PS: The themes were designed to make Python Code look good, as that's my primary langauge of work. So I have no idea how well it suits other programming Languages.
